## Changelog

### 0.6.5  (2017-02-02)

* (temporarily) enable play-rebel only in dev mode 

### 0.6  (2017-01-21)

* publish jar instead of zip: it's actually not a full-blown play module, just a set of java classes 
  (which we want to use in other play modules)
* added class RebelController to extend instead of play.mvc.Controller
* added default constructor RenderView()
* added RebelClassloader (that does not compiler neither enhance java classes)

### 0.5  (2017-01-13)

* added Result subclasses: RenderView and RedirectToAction

* fix method Renderer.templateAsString(): don't use Controller.renderArgs that is null in prod mode

### 0.3  (2017-01-02)

* make method renderTemplate(String, Map) public - it's useful for mocking out templates in unit-tests
